## Testee experience outline

**(first phase, the game)**

1. User presented with a splash screen, with an option to start the game.

2. When the user starts the game, the user is presented with an environment. 
    * size?: (large, small, outdoor, indoor)

    The user is also presented with some sort of integrated in game tutorial. 
    (elaborate)

3. user will interact with the environment in one of the following ways:
    * user can freely explore the environment, with one of the following constraints.
        * user has a time limit(ex: 2min)
        * user explores until they are content.
            * presses a UI button to exit
    * The user is guided through the environment
        * guided by prompts to navigate to(or find) landmarks, objects, etc...
        * user does a scavenger hunt
        * user must find a hidden item
        * pokemon snap
        * 'race game'
            * user is presented with a number of waypoints, they must navigate the environment to all of them(in any order)
                * do the waypoints change each time?
                * user is timed
                * user repeats this a number of times(ex: 4) with the goal of improving their time (by finding alternate routes)
        

**second phase(the test)**

4. When the user exits the environments, they are presented with it again
(2nd run tutorial)

5. below are possible test scenarios the user could experience.
    * there is an object missing.
        * the user has a toolbar containing all the possible missing items. The user selects and item and place's where they believe they saw it.
