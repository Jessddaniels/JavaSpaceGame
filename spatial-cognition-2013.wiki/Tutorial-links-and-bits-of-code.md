These are the links to some things I thought that could help.

[Terrain (video)](http://youtu.be/a4todUOBwlA)
* This is the video I used to make my terrain

[Grid Creation (code)](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/33564/grid-of-furniture-in-game-like-the-sims.html)
* code for making the grid system, in case we need it.

[Hack and Slash](http://www.burgzergarcade.com/hack-slash-rpg-unity3d-game-engine-tutorial) 
* This is a list of tutorials for a Hack and Slash type of game but we can use it for things like 'Character spawn points', 'Menus', 'Item Panels' as well as a better idea on how to use Unity in general.

[Simple First-Person Shooter Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbm9lPB5GPw)
* Here is a video I found for making rooms. It starts off at the basics so it's pretty good. The modeling tool used was Blender (but it's doable in Maya as well) 

[Turbo Squid](http://www.turbosquid.com)
* This is a good site for getting free models (search for price range 0 min 0 max and free ones will pop out)

[Texture Mapping](http://forums.creativecow.net/thread/61/858757) and [Creating UV Maps](http://www.jawa9000.com/Technical/UVs/UVs.htm)
* The first link is an explanation on how to make the texture map and the second link explains how to use that texture map

I haven't checked any of these except for the terrain and the 1st person shooter one so feel free to edit this and give your opinion on whether these are helpful or not.
