## General Construction

Builder's Viewpoint

The view of the test builder can be toggled between top-down and an isometric view that can switch between four different angles. The tester can toggle between these views at will.

Templates
   
Before the test builder can build a test world they will be prompted to select the style of that world. The templates will be flat and have only the most basic element in it (i.e. grass for forest or concrete for city)

Quickly Generated Objects

Where appropriate the test builder will be able quickly fill an area with objects. To do this the test builder will have to highlight an area and then select "fill". Ex: Selecting an area in the Forest Template and then selecting fill will cover that area in trees.

Roads
    
Roads will be built by the test builder from provided road concrete objects and paint

Bounds

The test builder will be able to place the physical test limitations using provided wall objects that are designed to be less intrusive to the test world template. 


## Waypoints

 Setting waypoints

* Tester will be able to select the type of waypoint they wish to add light beam or solid object
   * Solid object waypoints will require clicking on an object in the test world
   * Light beam will just require a place on the map to be selected
* Tester can remove waypoints by selecting the waypoint and then clicking the "remove" button in the menu

Tests and Questions

* Questions will be limited to areas near the waypoint as it is guaranteed that the test subject will be there
* Questions can include the standards such as
    * Missing Item
    * Place the Object
    * Ghost Landmark
    * Missing Landmark
* Tests could include
    * Optimizing Path: Tester will be able to specify a starting location and destination the same way as they specified waypoints using relevant icons.
    * Labyrinth: Tester will be able to select an environmental factor and its "density" that will appear in phase 2.
