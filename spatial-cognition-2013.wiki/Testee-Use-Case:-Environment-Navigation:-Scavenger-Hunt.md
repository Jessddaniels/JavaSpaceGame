## The Game

After the tutorial when the user has control and is allowed to freely roam the environment, there will be a small indication of certain items that must found at the bottom of the screen. There will or will not be a time limit; this is dependent on the options chosen by the tester. 

The user will place the cursor on an item and click. If the item is on the list they will take the item; items disappear when taken. The items on the scavenger list can be multiples of the same item and/or different items found in the game.

Once all items are found, the exit will open up allowing the player to end that stage. Afterwards they are brought to the 2nd stage.

_Jess Question: In what form will this "exit" be in? Is it a button or is it a literal door?_

* the items may be found in any order

## Second Stage: Testing
Playing the scavenger hunt gives the user an opportunity to explore the environment. Possible tests may include any of the following.
