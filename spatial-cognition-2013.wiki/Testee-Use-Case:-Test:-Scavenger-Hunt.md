## The Test

This test would occur after having having completed a [Scavenger Hunt](./Testee-Use-Case:-Environment-Navigation:-Scavenger-Hunt)

Having found the item once, we test the player's memory by timing their finding of an item from the scavenger hunt.

The UI and gameplay is mostly identical to the first [stage of the game](./Testee-Use-Case:-Environment-Navigation:-Scavenger-Hunt).

The Player will be told that they must complete this scavenger hunt as quickly as possible. The player now has a ticking timer on their screen.

### notes
* if the play must find multiple items, could we include how quickly they found them in the first stage? This might add a sense of urgency.
    * I think this also implies that they shouldn't know how quickly they find the items while playing the first stage
